# Purpose of this repo
This repo is to keep track of my progress learning web technologies. Though I already have a grasp and some experience with these technologies,
I'm going to be doing a lot of review. My reasoning being that I want a strong foundation of core web dev concepts to hopefully aid me in becoming a more 
competant dev as I learn newer technologies etc...

I'm going to be using the [roadmap.sh full stack roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/full-stack) as a way to stay on course and measure my progress. As I go through the 
roadmap and tick off some baseline learning, the goal is to utilize these new skills to build projects (starting from basic to hopefully more robust - baby steps :D ). 

## Jun 19, 2025
Currently reviewing HTML, CSS and JS topics. The last time I touched web dev in general was some time in early 2024 for a hackathon (second place baby!!), so it's been a while
and I need to catch up. Following along with the [html and css crash course by DesignCourse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-h8L5hgW-w) in the cssHtmlRefresher dir.
